# The Backlog

This is where I will keep a backlog of tasks that I will need to perform in order of priority. The tasks will be more specific the farther up the list they are and more vague the further down the list they are. Once vague tasks start getting nearer, I will break them up into specific tasks.

Due to the limited scope of this project, these will be development-level tasks.

[x] Create simple web application from the Visual Studio template and verify that it runs
[x] Create project for the data repositories
[x] Define the JSON file loader interface
[x] Write the JSON file loader unit tests
[] Implement the JSON file loader
[] Define the answer repository interface
[] Define the answer database interface
[] Write the tests for the answer database
[] Implement the code that loads the answers from the data file and applies the default sorting
[] Implement the rest of the answer database code
[] Write the tests for the answer repository
[] Implement the answer repository
[] Implement the controller tests
[] Implement the controller method for the main page so that it retrieves just the data for the student summary grid
[] Modify the layout to get rid of all the generated stuff that we don't want
[] Implement the main page view so that it displays the uglified student summary grid - completely unstyled
[] Apply some quick bootstrap styling to make it prettify it a little
[] Modify the view to render a Javascript data structure containing the data to be displayed
[] Apply some Knockout with Javascript to construct the grid from the Javascript data structure
[] Add functionality to dynamically sort the data by clicking on the column headers

-- Note: This is where I imagine that I will run out of time. Further backlog items will be less detailed and larger in scope. --

[] Implement the daily subject summaries on the main page
[] Display the date/time on the page indicating when the report was generated. This is easy because the moment is forever frozen in time on 2015-03-24 11:30:00 UTC, just like in that episode of the Twilight Zone.
[] Implement the student view minus the graph on its own page
[] Connect the student names on the main page to the student view page
[] Implement the subject pie chart on the main page
[] Implement the history graph showing progress over time
[] Implement the student lesson view on its own page
[] Connect the lessons on the student view to the lesson view
