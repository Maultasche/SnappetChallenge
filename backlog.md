# The Backlog

This is where I will keep a backlog of tasks that I will need to perform in order of priority. The tasks will be more specific the farther up the list they are and more vague the further down the list they are. Once vague tasks start getting nearer, I will break them up into specific tasks.

Due to the limited scope of this project, these will be development-level tasks.
