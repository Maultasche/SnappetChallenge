# De Snappet Challenge

Bedankt voor de leuke opdracht. Het was interessant.

I wrote down a narrative of what I was thinking as I was planning for and implementing this assignment. I feel that the thinking, planning, and design is just has important (if not more so) than the implementation, so I not only recorded what I was thinking, but also what I was planning. You can find that information in the [Narrative and Planning document](NarrativePlan.md).

I also kept a [backlog](backlog.md) of tasks that I needed to do. That one of the great things about the Agile/Scrum process that I've adopted for this assignment. It helps me to stack focused on what I need to do and gives me a good sense of what's coming up.

I wrote a lot more in the narrative and planning document, but I'll summarize what I did here. 
[Summarize the current status]

[Describe how to load the project and run the unit tests]
[Describe how to run the web application]
